    "\n",
    "<img src='images/data_imbalance_histogram.png' alt='Histogram of the data imbalance in the bees vs wasp dataset showing that there are many more images of wasps than other categories.' align='right'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to an advanced exploration of handling data imbalance! This notebook combines the power of [**transfer learning**](01.3_transfer_learning.ipynb) with **imbalance handling techniques** to tackle one of the most common challenges in real-world computer vision.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll:\n",
    "1. Work with the **full** bee vs wasp dataset (highly imbalanced)\n",
    "2. Use **EfficientNetB0** pre-trained features for better performance (We'll use the smaller B0 model here to help speed training along)\n",
    "3. Apply multiple imbalance handling techniques with transfer learning\n",
    "5. Evaluate comprehensive metrics appropriate for imbalanced datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Transfer Learning + Imbalance Handling?\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer learning is particularly powerful for imbalanced datasets because:\n",
    "- **Pre-trained features**: Rich representations learned from millions of images help even with limited minority class data\n",
    "- **Faster convergence**: Models train faster, allowing more experimentation with imbalance techniques\n",
    "- **Better generalization**: Pre-trained features often generalize better to minority classes\n",
    "- **Reduced overfitting**: Especially important when some classes have very few examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Challenge: Real-World Data Imbalance\n",
    "\n",
    "Real datasets are messy! The full bee vs wasp dataset contains:\n",
    "- **Thousands** of images for some classes\n",
    "- **Hundreds** for others\n",
    "- Natural distribution that reflects real-world collection challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates the perfect testbed for combining advanced model architectures with imbalance handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Lazy Student\n",
    "\n",
    "One way people explain data imbalance is using an analogy to a lazy student. Imagine that a professor makes a multiple choice test, and a student has figured out that the professor uses \"C\" as the correct answer 95% of the time. Why study for the test? The student can get a 95% just by answering \"C\" for all questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, with unbalanced data, the model can look like it's performing well--scoring a 95% accuracy for example--when in reality, it simply classifies every input as belonging to a class that represents 95% of the overall data. "

    "## 11. Key Insights: Transfer Learning + Imbalance Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our comprehensive experiments, here are the key insights when combining transfer learning with imbalance handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 **Transfer Learning Advantages for Imbalanced Data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Rich Feature Representations**: EfficientNetB0's pre-trained features help even minority classes by providing sophisticated visual understanding\n",
    "2. **Faster Convergence**: Models reach good performance in fewer epochs, allowing more experimentation with imbalance techniques\n",
    "3. **Better Generalization**: Pre-trained features often capture patterns that help minority classes generalize better\n",
    "4. **Reduced Overfitting**: Especially critical when some classes have very few examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 **Technique Performance Comparison:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feature Extraction Baseline**: \n",
    "   - Good starting point with pre-trained features\n",
    "   - May still be biased toward majority classes\n",
    "   - Fast training, lower computational cost\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Weighted Random Sampling**:\n",
    "   - Excellent for improving minority class performance\n",
    "   - Works particularly well with transfer learning\n",
    "   - Ensures balanced exposure during training\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Weighted Loss Function**:\n",
    "   - Good balance between majority and minority performance\n",
    "   - Maintains original data distribution\n",
    "   - Computationally efficient\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 **Best Practices for Transfer Learning + Imbalance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start with Feature Extraction**: Fast baseline to understand the problem\n",
    "2. **Apply Weighted Sampling**: Usually the most effective imbalance technique with transfer learning\n",
    "3. **Consider Fine-tuning**: For the best performance when computational resources allow\n",
    "4. **Monitor Per-Class Metrics**: Focus on macro-averaged metrics and per-class performance\n",
    "5. **Use Appropriate Input Size**: Match the pre-trained model's expected input (224x224 for EfficientNetB5)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 **When to Use Each Approach:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature Extraction + Weighted Sampling**: Best balance of performance and speed\n",
    "- **Fine-tuning + Weighted Sampling**: When you need maximum performance\n",
    "- **Weighted Loss**: When you want to maintain data distribution but improve minority class performance\n",
    "- **Combination Approaches**: Advanced users can combine multiple techniques for optimal results\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 **Real-World Applications:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This combination is particularly powerful for:\n",
    "- **Medical imaging**: Where rare conditions need accurate detection\n",
    "- **Quality control**: Where defects are rare but critical to catch\n",
    "- **Wildlife monitoring**: Where some species are much rarer than others\n",
    "- **Security applications**: Where threats are infrequent but important to identify"
