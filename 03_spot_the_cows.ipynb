We have a dataset of images of livestock, and we need to build a model that can accurately identify the different types of livestock in the images. We also need to be able to segment the livestock from the background. Can you handle this for me?\" Kevin nods, and his boss hands him the dataset. \"I need this done by the end of the week,\" his boss says as he walks away. Kevin looks at the dataset and sighs.
