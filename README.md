Welcome to Practicum AI’s Computer Vision Course!

This is the repository for the Computer Vision course. 

Welcome to Practicum AI’s Computer Vision Course! In these modules, we’ll build on what we’ve learned about deep neural networks to demystify the technology that allows machines to interpret and make decisions based on visual data. Each module in this course will provide hands-on experiences to create your own working models. In Module 1, we will explore the nuances among the computer vision tasks of image classification, object detection, and image segmentation and explain how they work. By the end, you'll be ready to instantiate and employ a computer vision model to make predictions.

In this course we’ll cover:

* Module 1: Computer Vision Concepts
* Module 2: Understanding Computer Vision Tasks
* Module 3: Optimizing Computer Vision Models

Good luck!
